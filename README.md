# Pomelo web front end

# Installation

The following instructions are with yarn, though __npm__ should work too.
```
$ yarn
```

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

`yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

`yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.

See the section about [running tests](#running-tests) for more information.

`yarn run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.
Your app is ready to be deployed!

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

This works as create-react-app's eject command.
